*	On game start you will see the main menu containing two character sprites.
*	Click on a sprite to select that character and the main game will open.
*	The game starts immediately with you falling to the ground and projectiles flying at
*	you from the right. If you hit the ground or a projectile you will die.
*	If you click the screen you will glide upwards very slightly (multiple clicks allowed).
*	Score increases for every projectile that has moved off screen to the left.
*	Apon death, you will end up on the game over screen still displaying the final score
*	and with a sprite of your dead character lying on the ground. Click the dead character
*	sprite to go back to the main menu to restart the game.
